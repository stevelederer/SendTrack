# SendTrack

## SendTrack lets you easily share songs using Apple Music or Spotify!

Have you ever had a friend send you a link to a song from a music streaming service you don't use? Ever wanted to send a song to a friend who you know uses a different streaming service? With SendTrack it's easy to share song links for either Spotify or Apple Music!

There are a number of ways to use SendTrack to share songs. The easiest way is to search directly in the app for the song you are looking to send. Then simply tap on the share button for the service you want to share, and that's it!

You can also copy a song link from your music app of choice and launch SendTrack to automatically search for that song.

Third, SendTrack also has an iMessage app to make it even easier to share a song directly from the messages app! Just open the messages app, tap the SendTrack icon, search for a song, and you're ready to share a link to the song!
